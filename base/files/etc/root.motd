 YOU ARE USING THE ROOT ACCOUNT. MOST ACTIONS AREN'T SUPPORTED AS ROOT INSIDE A
 MICROBOX CONTAINER. MOST OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT SET UP, INCLUDING ASDF, WHEN
   RUNNING AS ROOT DIRECTLY. ADDITONALLY, MOST ACTIONS YOU NEED TO BE ROOT TO
  PERFORM WON'T PERSIST INTO YOUR DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT. UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY
  WHAT YOU'RE DOING, SWITCH TO THE GOMICRO USER AND USE SUDO TO PERFORM ACTIONS
                 THAT NEED ROOT ACCESS. - The Microbox Dev Team
